# web-building-blocks

This is a small collection of building blocks that I've pulled together to use
in web sites.

- Lookup
  - `CodeLookup` Simple lookup, initialised by objects. Returns value of key.
  - `TieredCache` An arbitrary nested lookup. Alpha status!
- Storage
  - `StorageItem` Wrapper to manage items in session storage
